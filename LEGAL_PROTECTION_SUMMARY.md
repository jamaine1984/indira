## 🎓 LEGAL DISCLAIMER

**This document is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice.**

While these Terms of Service and Privacy Policy provide strong legal protections based on industry standards for dating apps, they do not guarantee immunity from all legal claims. We recommend:

1. Consulting with a licensed attorney in your jurisdiction
2. Obtaining general liability insurance
3. Operating through an LLC or corporation (not as individual)
4. Monitoring user reports and taking swift action on violations
5. Keeping detailed records of user violations and terminations

**No legal document can prevent 100% of lawsuits**, but these documents significantly reduce your liability and provide strong defenses against common dating app claims.
